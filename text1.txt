The purpose of this application is to provide valuable insights into your business by analyzing yearly Etsy sales order data. Through the use of interactive plots, this app helps users gain a deeper understanding of their operations. If you are an Etsy user, you can upload your transaction records as a CSV file obtained from the Etsy website. To do this, sign in to your account and navigate to Shop Manager > Settings > Options > Download Data. Use the dropdown menus to select the CSV type, and if you wish to download an entire year, select the year without specifying a month. Finally, click Download Orders as a CSV to save the file to your computer. Alternatively, if you do not have an Etsy store, you can still explore the app by using the default data available within the app.
